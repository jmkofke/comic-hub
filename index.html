			<h2> What are Webcomics? </h2>

			<p>  Comics on the web. Duh. </p>
			<p>Nah, I'm messing with you. Believe it or not, there's actually a lot more to it than that. </p>
			<p>The great thing about the Internet is that anyone, anywhere, can put things out there. That includes a huge chunk of immensely talented, wonderfully creative, and fantastically entertaining people. And also webcomic artists. (Kidding.)<br></p>
			<p>Basically anything you can imagine is out there. An imaginative adaption of the story of Jekyll and Hyde? Out there. A story about an inn for time travellers? Yep. The adventures of teenagers whose various body-parts have become adorable companion monsters? We've got you.</p>
			<p> And the best part? None of these have to go through pesky plans to maximize profits. None of these have to be approved and processed to never challenge the status quo. This creates the chance to be diverse, representational, and connected to everyday people like you and me. These people just have a story they want to tell, without worrying about what is or isn't profitable and safe.</p>
			<p>This also gives the authors opportunities to be directly connected to their readers, fostering a sense of closeness and community. You can see that they're enjoying their work just as much as you are, and are appreciative of you and your feedback. It helps develop a connection to the comic, and fosters a community of fans. </p>

			<p>Not sold? Give it a shot. Either pick your favorite genre from the sidebar over on the left, or check out my Top 10 list of favorites from the top bar. It was super hard to pick just ten though, so I encourage you to explore the rest of the recommendations too! Got a favorite webcomic you don't see here? Let me know about it! Just check out that Submit page also on the top bar. Enjoy!</p>
